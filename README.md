# Project Creator Script

This is a simple shell script to help you quickly create a new web project. The script generates basic project files such as `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`, and also opens the project in **VS Code**.

## Steps to Use the Script

Follow these steps to set up and use the script on your machine:
### 1. Open Git Bash


### 2. Create a new file

Run the following command to create a new file named `create-project.sh`:

```bash
touch create-project.sh
```

### 3. Add the script content

Open the `create-project.sh` file you just created and copy the content from the `create-project.sh` file in this repository into it.

### 4. Give the script execution rights

Make the script executable by running this command:

```bash
chmod +x create-project.sh
```

### 5. Run the script

Now you can use the script to create a new project. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
./create-project.sh project-name
```

**Note:** Replace `project-name` with the desired name for your project.
